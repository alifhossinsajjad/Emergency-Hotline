1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans : GetElementById is used to find a specific and unique element. GetElementByClassName is used to find an element using only the class name. QuerySelector is used to find a specific element of a child node or a parent node, similarly QuerySelectorAll is used to find every element of a child node or a parent node.
